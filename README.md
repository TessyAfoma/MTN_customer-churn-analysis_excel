# MTN_customer-churn-analysis_excel
## Project Overview
Customer churn (the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company) is one of the biggest challenges in the telecommunications industry. This project focuses on recognizing and analysing the factors driving churn in MTN, a top network provider. The goal is to make data-driven decisions that will reduce churn rate, thus improving revenue and profitability.
### Dataset
The analysis is based on real customer data obtained from MTN. The dataset contains 974 rows and 17 columns.
### Tools
Microsoft Excel
### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**
- Imported the dataset into Excel
- Converted raw data into an Excel Table for easier analysis (Ctrl + T)
- Checked for Missing values (e.g., (blank) in Reason for Churn), Consistency in date formatting, and Standardized numeric columns (Revenue, Data Usage).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Categorized and created two sheets for the data based on data types: numerical data and categorical data.
- Performed EDA using Pivot Tables to answer the following questions:
  - What are our customer demographics (age, gender, state...)?
  - What subscription plans are most popular?
  - What was the reason for churn?
  - How much revenue did the business lose due to churn (impacted revenue)?
  - What was the percentage impact of churn on revenue?
  - What was the best-performing month?
  - How satisfied are customers with our products?

### ðŸ“Š Key Dashboards
### 1 **Numerical Dashboard**
Contains pivot tables, charts, and slicers.
- Number of purchases
- Count of unit price
- Follow-up visit frequency
- Satisfaction score by demographics
- Total revenue
- Total data usage, etc

### 2 **Overview Dashboard**
KPIs
- Total Revenue
- Impacted Revenue (revenue affected by churn)
- % Impacted (percentage of churn impact on revenue)
- Sum of Data Usage

Slicers and Charts
- Subscription plans and MTN Device
- Customer state, age, reviews
- Reasons for Churn
- Purchase date

### Results 
The key insights from the analysis can be summarized as follows:

Churned customers resulted in a 29% impact on total revenue, approximately #58,000,000 naira.

Certain states (Osun, Abuja) had higher churn than the others.

Subscription Plans: Mid- to high-data broadband plans were most impacted.

The majority of churners rated service as "Poor" or cited Poor Network as the main reason.

The dataset shows that female customers had slightly higher churn rates than males.

### Recommendations

- Improve Network Quality in churn-heavy states to address the top reason for churn.
- Introduce targeted retention offers for customers on high-churn subscription plans.
- Enhance customer support to reduce dissatisfaction and improve review ratings.
- Track churn monthly to detect patterns early and intervene.
